I'm graduated in Computer Science and I have an MBA in Software Engineering by Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. I've been working as a software developer for more than 10 years already, mainly in Agile projects.

Most of my experience is related to Java (Spring and J2E), but I have also professional experience in PHP and JavaScript. Lately, I've played with R, Scala, Kotlin, Python and a bunch of different technologies, in order to catch up with the trends and push myself.

I hope you enjoy this page and find something useful.
