I'm graduated in Computer Science and I have an MBA in Software Engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.

I've been working as a software developer for more than 10 years already, mainly in Agile projects.

Most of my experience is related to Java (Spring and J2E), but I also have professional experience with PHP and JavaScript. Lately, I've played with R, Scala, Kotlin, Python and a bunch of different tools, in order to catch up with the trends and push myself.

I hope you enjoy this page and find something useful.
