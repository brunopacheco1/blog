Yesterday we had the "Pitch my team!" in Pictet Technologies, where we'd have 5 minutes to share in general what we've been doing in 2019. I'll be honest that I wasn't excited about it in the beginning. You know, me going to a stage, grabbing a mic a say something to a hundred people.

But then my team lead Misi had a brilliant idea of recording a video, using Prezi Video. With it, you can overlay the video camera output with the slides, allowing you to interact with the content. And after that, we had a funny couple of hours recording the video.

The result was pretty clear, we won the voting for the best presentation! :blush: When I got the result I was astonished, as the other 19 teams provided also gorgeous detailed presentations.
